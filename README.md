## Analysis and Challenges
The advantages of the refactoring of our code demonstrated to be less resource and time consuming than the original process, even when the time difference is not significant for the amount of date we processed, the code we have created can be useful to process larger amounts of data.
## Results
The results of the analysis executed with the information we have display through the code represent the performance of a list of stocks from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2017 and 2018; however, it does not display an average performance or yield during the year, te results presented in the display we created better presents the momentum of a piece of the stock market at the end of the years 2017 and 2018 and is not enterily useful to make investment decissions.
